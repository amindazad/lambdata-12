What is a situation where a document store (like MongoDB) is appropriate, and what is a situation where it is not appropriate?
NoSQL(MongoDB) tends to be a better option for modern applications that are larger in size ,have more complex, constantly changing data sets, 
requiring a flexible data model that doesnâ€™t need to be immediately defined. Most developers or organizations that prefer NoSQL databases, 
are attracted to the agile features that allow them to go to market faster, make updates faster. Unlike traditional, SQL(relational, Elaphantsql) based, relational databases, 
NoSQL databases can store and process data in real-time.While SQL databases do still have some specific use cases, NoSQL databases have many features that SQL databases are not capable of handling 
without tremendous costs, and critical sacrifices of speed, agility, etc.

What is "NewSQL", and what is it trying to achieve?
NewSQL is a new approach to relational databases that wants to combine transactional ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability)
and the horizontal scalability of NoSQL. It sounds like a perfect solution, the best of both worlds.
